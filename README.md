# Hi, Thank You For Checking Out This Project- 

## About This Project:

What the application does: This is a simple & very minimalistic calculator that only takes in two numbers as inputs, and adds them. 
The bmi calculator portion will take the user's weight (in KG) and height (in metres) and will calculate the BMI to the first decimal place.

Motivation Behind Creation: I've recently learnt about Node.js & ExpressJS for the back-end servers. So I was putting all of what I had learnt into practice.

Key Learning Points Included:
- Listening to the ports for clients (Browsers)
- GET/POST Requests: When a GET Request is made by the client it is sent to the back-end. Which then will then execute a command when triggered. A POST request
can be made internally within the .html file, which pushes the request to the back-end and update it on the client side.
- Action: Refers to the location of which the Method (In this case; POST) is being pushed to.

Technologies Used: 
- HTML
- Node.js
- Express.js (Nodeman & Body-Parser Packages)
